# Landing page
A simple landing page design by using mostly flexbox as project guided by The Odin Project. By practicing flex theories, build this project as I learnt. As a project idea, I inspire [cdbaby.com](https://cdbaby.com/) mostly. Photos & contents are all credit to inspired website. 

Alert : This project is only built for desktop size.

Note: This project is a part of The Odin Project.

## Demo
Live: [https://ursvee.github.io/odin-landing/](https://ursvee.github.io/odin-landing/)

## Minify
I use [minify extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.minify) in VSCode to minify index.html & styles.css.

To install, Use `ext install HookyQR.minify` in VSCode terminal.

__Usage__

To minify index.html as example, in index.html, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `minify` and press `Enter`.
